# Playtest notes

Required by GDD §25.1 and §25.3: "a playtest note states what became more or less fun."

The §27.3 questions to ask, once there is something to play:

- What did the team try that the game allowed, or unexpectedly prevented?
- When did weight and grip become understandable?
- Did preparation feel like a choice or a chore?
- Could players predict cargo shift and damage?
- Was the invoice funny and useful, or merely punitive?
- Which moment would they tell a friend about?
- Would they replay the same contract differently?

## Phase 0 — 2026-08-18

**Nothing is playable yet, and no fun claim is made.** Phase 0 is a loop, an action map and
a scene; there is no character to move and nothing to pick up. The §25.2 gate for this
phase is "loads locally; stable frame/step", which is a correctness gate, not a fun gate.

The one observation worth recording is about the diagnostic scene rather than the game:
putting the couch and three real doorways on screen at true scale, against a metre grid,
made the central clearance problem obvious immediately — obvious enough that the 30 mm
shortfall at a 32" door turned up on day one instead of at Phase 5. That is the argument
for building diagnostic geometry early even when nothing can move yet.

First real entry will be Phase 1 (movement), where "responsive indoors and on ramp" is
something a person can actually judge.

## Phase 1 — movement — 2026-08-19

**First build a person can actually move in.** No external playtest yet; this is the
author's note, and §25.3 asks for "what became more or less fun", so:

**More fun.** The mantle is the surprise. It was written to satisfy §5.1's Climbing state
and turned out to change how the test level reads — once you can pull yourself onto a
0.6 m ledge, low geometry stops being scenery and becomes route. That is §8.1's
"architecture as puzzle" showing up two phases before the architecture does, which is
encouraging for the pillar.

**Neutral, and worth watching.** Sprint at 5.4 m/s feels slightly too fast indoors — the
room is 10 x 7 m and you cross it in under two seconds. Not changed yet, because §25.1 says
not to tune on one person's opinion, and because a mover carrying a couch will be slower by
construction from Phase 3. Flagging it so the first real playtest has something to check.

**Cannot be judged yet.** The gate word is "responsive", and responsiveness while carrying
something heavy is the version that actually matters for this game. Right now the mover is
unladen and every input is instant, which is the easy case. The honest read is that Phase 1
proves the controller is not the problem, not that the movement is good.

**Nothing to tell a friend about yet**, which is the correct state for Phase 1 — §29.1 says
make movement feel good before grabbing, and grabbing is where the stories start.

## Phase 2 — one box — 2026-08-19

**First build where the game is about an object rather than about walking.** Author's note
again; no external playtest yet.

**More fun, and it is the first time that sentence means anything.** Picking a box up,
turning, and putting it down somewhere else is already a small loop with a shape to it. The
best moment is unplanned: because the hold offset is stored in the VIEW frame, the box
stays where you grabbed it relative to your head — so turning your body swings the box
around you, and you can feel it lag. That is the first hint of §1.4's "physical discovery"
beat, and it arrived from a bug fix rather than from a feature.

**Actively worse, and worth watching.** A one-handed hold swings. Grab a box by a corner
and lift and it pendulums, and if you keep lifting it eventually tears out of your hand.
Correct physics; unclear whether it reads as "I grabbed it badly" (good — that is §6.2
working) or "the game took my box away" (bad). This is the single thing to put in front of
another person first.

**Cannot be judged yet.** Everything about §6.2 that needs a SECOND pair of hands — two
movers on one object, forces adding, opposing inputs twisting it. Phase 4.

**Would I tell a friend about it?** Not yet. But there is now a thing to describe, which
was not true after Phase 1: "you can pick a box up and it swings if you grab it wrong."

## Phase 3 — heavy object — 2026-08-19

**First build where an object argues back.** Author's note; still no external playtest.

**More fun, clearly.** The couch is a different KIND of thing from a box, and it took no
special-casing to make it so — the same grip, with mass and a reaction force, produces an
object you approach differently. Grabbing it one-handed and feeling the mover get tugged
sideways is the first moment this has felt like the game the GDD describes rather than a
physics demo.

**The best accident.** Being knocked down drops what you were carrying, because that is the
consequence rather than a state flag. Overreaching with the couch and watching it land on
the driveway while the mover picks themselves up is genuinely funny, and it is §18.1's
"escalate through wobble → warning → failure → new problem" happening without anyone
authoring a wobble.

**Actively worse.** Dragging is unsatisfying. You can get the couch moving but not keep it
moving, so it shuffles. Right now the honest way to move a couch is to lift it with two
braced hands and waddle, which is not what §6.3 describes. This is the thing to fix before
Phase 4, because co-op will be judged against it.

**Cannot be judged yet.** Everything two-person. §6.2's "mover count — forces add; opposing
inputs can twist objects or drag teammates" is the payoff the whole heavy-object model is
building toward, and it is Phase 4.

**Would I tell a friend about it?** Yes, one thing: "I tried to carry a couch on my own and
it knocked me over." That is the first sentence out of this project that sounds like the
game it is meant to be.
